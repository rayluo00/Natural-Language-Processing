========================================== OVERVIEW ==========================================
This program will classify the email as a spam or nonspam
email based of Naive Bayes theorem. The output displays a
2x2 table for a positive/negative table, precision percentage,
recall percentage, and f-score. After the program in trained
from NaiveBayes.py, it will call a function from TestNaiveBayes.py
to run a testing program with the testing set.

IMPORTANT! To run the program, it uses Python3 and requires
a spam and nonspam training and testing set directories.
Provided are the training and testing sets labelled as,
"spam-train", "nonspam-train", "spam-test", "nonspam-test".
The four directories must be located in the same directory 
as the NaiveBayes.py and TestNaiveBayes.pv files.

======================================== DATASET NOTE ========================================
This dataset comes from the Lingspam Dataset, 
specifically, the lemm-stop subset. The emails have been
edited to remove punctuation and standalone numbers.
The "Subject" word that begins each email has been removed.
Additionally, all tabs and newlines have been 
collapsed to a single space.

The original dataset can be found here:
